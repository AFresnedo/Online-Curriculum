analytics is the best place to learn/test/implement javascript and ajax
    -controller loads everything up (how much?)
        -problem scores
        -hints asked
    -view has a dynamic display of data that teacher/admin manipulates
    -graphs, numbers, charts, different perspectives
    -scope change (all? 1 curr? 3 con? 2 prob?)
    -time change

seed fake user data for analytics like you feed fake users?
