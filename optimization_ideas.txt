first slowdown detected during graph model tests
    -im worried that having the progression logic in a file apart from the
    content files is forcing too many queries to "get id of next file"
        -going to continue programming it this way regardless, shouldnt be that

        the....hmmm, i cant even think of it
            -probably worried about nothing, havent even made indicies yet
