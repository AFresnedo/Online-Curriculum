some documentation notes that are essential at this stage because they aren't
standard conventions (or really named all that well):

globalgraph controller: this controller is in charge of "curriculum liveliness"
at the curriculum and category level
    -creates "ip" tuples as soon as they are unlocked
    -new = new curriculum (new globalgraph.txt)
    -update = edit curriculum (edit globalgraph.txt)

graph controller: this controller is in charge of "curriculum liveliness" at
the context level
    -navigates to "next" ip tuple
    -new = new do-able context (new graph.txt)
    -update = edit a context progression (change a graph.txt)

why globalgraph/graph controllers designed this way? mostly, because it's
a direct representation of Razvan's input and there didn't seem to be an
obvious way of doing it better
    -this answer has to do with globalgraph/graph models as well

curriculum controller: this controller is in charge of editing the curriculum
    -you can think of it as the master tool for creating globalgraph, graph,
    theory, and problem; so that they remain linked

    -new = new theory, problem, globalgraph, graph
    -update = edit a content file or a curriculum progression logic file
