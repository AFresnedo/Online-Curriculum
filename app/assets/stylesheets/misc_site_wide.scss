// ideally, this file is minimal; refactor as needed
// an example of refactoring is if, eventually, there are 5+ entries for
// body..these would be refactored into a seperate _body.scss

// for header not overlapping body IF bootstrap containers do not fix
// body {
  // padding-top: 60px;
// }

// for hiding elements
.hide {
  display: none;
}
