  # for now, just index each context and show batches
  # i want to simulate the globalgraph through user-choice hyperlinks
  # after that, i want a portal of ACTUAL user choice with headings seperating
  # each category (ALGEBRAIC, etc, pretend that a user can't skip a heading
  # section); inside of that are the links to user-choice folders (liquids,
  # casetry, etc) and then once they pick one of those links i want it to go
  # through the progression with succeed/fail linkage
