handling unlocked theories:
    -at the moment the graph model returns unlock theories based on user's
    latest problem
    -it may be better to have some att somewhere that has a list of unlocked
    theories that simply gets appended instead
        -why does it matter? because the graph model only has to find the next
        local problem/theory OR check the globalgraph for the next local
        group...it does not need to backtrace all the problems done before
        whereas unlocked theories WOULD require that...obviously much worse
