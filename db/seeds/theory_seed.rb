It is known that 29 students play volleyball\r\nand 37 students play basketball. Find out how many students\r\nplay both sports.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n<b>Solution:</b> \r\nIf we assume that none of the students plays both volleyball \r\nand basketball, then the students who play volleyball are\r\ndifferent from those who play basketball. So the total number\r\nof students is \\(29+37=66\\) students. This number is \r\nway bigger than \\(47\\) and the difference comes from\r\nthe students who play both sports. Those students were\r\ncounted twice, so their number is \\(66-47=\\color{red}{19}\\). \r\nThis is how many students play both sports.\r\n</p> \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n<b>Example 2:</b> \r\nA rock band has sold online the mp3's of its 3 songs\r\nfor a total of  9870 dollars. One third of the downloads\r\nwere of the first song, at 1.56 dollars each, one fourth\r\nof the downloads were of the second song, at 1.65 dollars each,\r\nand the rest were of the third song, at 1.71 dollars each.\r\nHow many downloads of each song were there?\r\n<p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n<b>Solution:</b> \r\nFirst note that \r\n\\begin{eqnarray*}\r\n1-\\frac{1}{3}-\\frac{1}{4}=\\frac{5}{12}\r\n\\end{eqnarray*}\r\nof the downloads were of the third song. Let us\r\nassume that there were 120 downloads altogether.\r\nThen the total amount of money made by the rock band would\r\nbe\r\n\\begin{eqnarray*}\r\n\\frac{120}{3}\\times 1.56+\\frac{120}{4}\\times 1.65+\\frac{120\\times 5}{12}\\times 1.71=62.4+49.5+85.5=197.4\\mbox{ dollars}.\r\n\\end{eqnarray*}\r\nThis is way smaller than the actual amount. To find the original\r\nsum we notice that the amount of dollars earned is proportional\r\nto the number of mp3's sold, if the 3 songs are sold in\r\nthe same proportions. So we can apply the rule of three:\r\n\\begin{alignat*}{1}\r\n120\\quad ............&\\quad 9870\\\\\r\n? \\quad ............&\\quad 197.4,\r\n\\end{alignat*}\r\nWe obtain the total number of mp3's sold to be \r\n\\begin{eqnarray*}\r\n\\frac{120\\times 197.4}{9870}=6000.\r\n\\end{eqnarray*}\r\nOf these, those of the first song were \\(\\frac{6000}{3}=\\color{red}{2000}\\), of the second song \\(\\frac{6000}{4}=\r\n\\color{red}{1500}\\) and of the third song \\(6000-2000-1500=\\color{red}{2500}\\).\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nAnd now some problems for you. \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<!-- end explanation of theory  -->\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n")

The white rice\r\ncomes at 3 dollars a pound and the black rice comes at 4 dollars a pound. How much of each type should be used in the mix?\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<!-Gheba, modified-->\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n<b>Solution:</b> \r\nThe method of false hypothesis consists of <dfn>making one\r\nassumption</dfn>, which most of the time proves false.\r\nUsing this additional  assumption we estimate a desired\r\noutcome, and if the outcome differs from what we want, then\r\nwe learn how to modify the contents of the assumption so\r\nthat we obtain what we want.  \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nIn the case of this problem, we make the assumption that\r\nwe use only white rice. \r\nThen the entire quantity \r\ncosts \\(3\\times 700=2100\\) dollars. But the mix that we are\r\nsupposed to produce is sold for \\(700\r\n\\times 3.60=2520\\) dollars. \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nWe compare the two sums and we see a \r\n difference of \\(2520-2100=420\\) dollars. This difference\r\n comes from the black rice. Since for each pound of black\r\nrice that replaces a pound of white rice the price goes up by one dollar, there should be <font color=\"red\">420</font> pounds of \r\nblack rice. Then there are \\(700-420=\\color{red}{280}\\) pounds of\r\nwhite rice. \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nIn this problem we were told that two types of rice are used,\r\nand we assumed, falsely, that only one type of rice is used.\r\nIn general, for a problem that assumes the use\r\nof two types of objects we assume only one type is used, get\r\nthe wrong outcome, and then rectify the quantities to\r\nget the correct outcome. Here is a second example.\r\n</p>\r\n <p>\r\n<b>Example 2:</b> A garment factory sent to a store children \r\ncoats and suits, in  total  139 pieces, for a total of 6828 dollars. A coat costs 42 dollars and a suit costs 60 dollars.\r\nHow many coats and how many suits were sent? \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<!-Calugaru, modified-->\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n<b>Solution:</b> Let us assume that only suits were sent.\r\n139 suits would have cost\r\n\\begin{eqnarray*}\r\n139\\times 60=8340\\mbox{ dollars}.\r\n\\end{eqnarray*}\r\nThis exceeds the total cost by \\(8340-6828=1512\\) dollars.\r\nFor each suit replaced by a coat, the cost drops by \r\n\\(60-42=18\\) dollars. We have to replace \\(\\frac{1512}{18}=84\\)\r\nsuits by coats. So there were <font color=\"red\">84</font> coats\r\nand \\(139-84=\\color{red}{55}\\) suits.  \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nTry to apply the same reasoning in the following exercises:\r\n<p>\r\n<!-- end explanation of theory  -->\r\n\r\n\r\n")

Here is an example: \r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n<b>Example 1:</b>\r\nJim has bought some papayas (at 4 dollars a piece)\r\nand pineapples (at 5 dollars a piece) and he has spent\r\n22 dollars. How many papayas and how many pineapples did he\r\nbuy?\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n<b>Solution:</b> \r\nJim could not buy too many fruits for 22 dollars, in fact\r\nhe has bought less than \\(\\frac{22}{4}=5.5\\) papayas\r\nand less than \\(\\frac{22}{5}=4.4\\) pineapples.\r\nSo he bought 1,2,3, or 4 pineapples.  \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nWe can try to see case-by-case, how many pineapples did he\r\nactually buy:\r\n<ol>\r\n<li><b>Case 1:</b> He bought 1 pinneapple. Then he is left\r\nwith \\(22-5=17\\) dollars, so he must have bought \\(\\frac{17}{4}=4.25\\) papayas, not a whole number. So this case is ruled out. </li>\r\n\r\n<li><b>Case 2:</b> He bought 2 pinneaples. Then he\r\nis left with \\(22-2\\times 5=12\\) dollars, so he must\r\nhave bought \\(\\frac{12}{4}=3\\) papayas. This can happen, but \r\nare there other possibilities?</li>\r\n\r\n<li><b>Case 3:</b> He bought 3 pinneaples. Then he\r\nis left with \\(22-3\\times 5=7\\) dollars, so he must\r\nhave bought \\(\\frac{7}{4}=1.75\\) papayas. This is not possible,\r\ncase ruled out.</li>\r\n\r\n<li><b>Case 4:</b> He bought 4 pinneaples. Then he\r\nis left with \\(22-4\\times 5=2\\) dollars, not enough\r\nto buy a papaya. This\r\ncase is ruled out, as well.</li>\r\n\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\nTherefore, by examining the four cases above, we see that only Case 2\r\nis possible, so Jim bought <font color=\"red\">3</font> papayas\r\nand <font color=\"red\">2</font> pineapples. \r\n \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThis was a fortunate situation where the list of cases \r\nwas short, but what should you do if the list is long,\r\nand it becomes tiresome to check all cases. In that happens,\r\nyou should try to shorten the list by clever arguments,\r\nand try to reduce significantly the number of cases. \r\nHere is an example of this kind:\r\n </p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n<b>Example 2:</b>\r\nCeline bought  23-dollar, 22-dollar, and\r\n20-dollar T-shirts, spending a total of 132 dollars. How many\r\nT-shirts of each kind did she buy? \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n<b>Solution:</b> \r\nThe phrasing of the problem tells us that Celine bought \r\nat least one T-shirt of each kind. So let us take aside\r\na 23-dollar, a 22-dollar, and a 20-dollar T-shirt. \r\nThe remaing \\(132-23-22-20=67\\) dollars was spend on\r\nsome other T-shirts. Two T-shirts would be two few, as \\(23+23=46\\) which is less than \\(67\\), and four T-shirts are too many since \r\n\\(20+20+20+20=80\\) which is greater than \\(67\\).\r\nSo exactly 3 T-shirts were bought for the amount. \r\n<ol>\r\n<li><b>Case 1:</b> \r\nWith the 67 dollars no 23-dollar T-shirt was bought. Then 3\r\nT-shirts, \r\nsome 22-dollar and some 20-dollar,  were bought for\r\nthis amount. But 3 T-shirts would cost at most\r\n\\(22+22+22=66\\) dollars, so this case is impossible. </li>\r\n\r\n<li><b>Case 2:</b> One 23-dollar T-shirt was bought. \r\nCeline is left with \\(67-23=44\\) dollars, and this amount\r\nhas to be spend on two 22-dollar T-shirts. This case works!\r\nBut are there other possibilities?\r\n</li>\r\n\r\n<li><b>Case 3:</b> Two 23-dollar T-shirts were bought. Celine \r\nis now left with \\(67-46=21\\) dollars, and this is not\r\nthe price of a T-shirt.\r\n</li>\r\n<li><b>Case 4:</b> Three 23-dollar T-shirts were bought. But\r\n\\(23\\times 3=69\\) which is larger than 67, so this case\r\nand all other cases are impossible. \r\n</li>\r\n\r\n</ol>\r\nWe conclude that Celine bought <font color=\"red\">1</font>\r\n20-dollar T-shirt, <font color=\"red\">3</font> 22-dollar\r\nT-shirts, and <font color=\"red\">2</font> 23-dollar T-shirts. \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nHere is a third example. \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n<b>Example 3:</b>\r\nYou have 4 coins, two are real, and two are fake. The real\r\ncoins have equal weights, and the  fake\r\ncoins also have equal  weights and are lighter than the real coins.\r\nYou also have a balanced scale.  What is\r\nthe smallest number of weighings necessary\r\nto find the two fake coins? \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n<b>Solution:</b> \r\nWe will show that the number is <font color=\"red\">2</font>.\r\nFirst, we need to show that we cannot do it with one weighing.\r\nSince the scale is balanced, we only have two possibilities:\r\n<ol>\r\n<li><b>Case 1.</b> We place only one coin on each side\r\nof the scale. If it happens that  they are of the same weight, we cannot detect a single fake coin there. </li>\r\n<li><b>Case 2.</b> We place two coins on each side of\r\nthe scale. If the scale is in equilibrium, we know there is\r\none fake coin on each side, but we cannot tell which one it is.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\nSo one weighing is not enough. Let us see that two weighings are.\r\nPlace one coin on each side of the scale. \r\n<ol>\r\n<li><b> Case 1.</b> Both sides have the same weight. So\r\nthey are either both real or both fake. The other two coins are\r\nalso of equal weights. So now we can split\r\nthe four coins into two groups, with the two coins in each\r\ngroup having the same weight. Now measure one group agains the\r\nother to decide which group consists of the fake coins. \r\n\r\n<li><b> Case 2.</b> One side is lighter. That side has a fake coin.\r\nMeasure it agains any of the remaining two coins. If\r\nthey are equal, both are fake. If one is heavier, that\r\nis a real coin, and the fourth coin is fake. \r\n</ol>\r\nWe are done. \r\n</p>\r\n\r\nTry to see if you can solve the problems that follow. \r\n\r\n<!-- end explanation of theory  -->\r\n\r\n\r\n")

Thus the 30 yards must be \\(\\frac{1}{3}\\) of what they\r\nhad at the beginning of that day, so they ended the second\r\nday with \\(3\\times 30=90\\) yards of wire.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThe 90 yards of wire they had at the end of the second day, plus\r\nthe other 30 yards should be \\(1-\\frac{1}{3}=\\frac{2}{3}\\) of what\r\nthey had at the beginning of the second day. If \\(30+90=120\\) is\r\n\\(\\frac{2}{3}\\) of the entire quantity, then \\(\\frac{1}{3}\\)\r\nof the quantity is half that much, that is 60, and so\r\nthe entire quantity of wire that the boy scouts had at the beginning of that day is \\(120+60=180\\) yards. \r\n\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nSo the boy scouts ended the first day with \\(180\\) yards of wire. \r\nPut 40 yards on top of that, and you get \\(180+40=220\\) yards\r\nof wire, which is what was left after using \\(\\frac{1}{3}\\) of\r\nthe entire amount of wire.

In\r\nthe following problem the quantities are inverse proportional, meaning that\r\none of them is proportional to the reciprocal of the other.  \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n<b>Example:</b> The price of a cruise is fixed, and  is divided evenly \r\namong passengers.

How much do 7 apples cost?  \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n<b>Solution:</b> \r\nThe number of apples is proportional to the cost. So if one apple costs a certain\r\namount of money, then 5 apples cost 5 times that amount. \r\nSo, if 5 apples cost 1.3 dollars, then one apple costs one fifth of that,\r\nthat is \\(\\frac{1.3}{5}=\\color{red}{0.26}\\) dollars, in other words it\r\ncosts 26 cents.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n  Then 7 apples cost 7 times the price of one apple, that is \r\n\\(7\\times .26=\\color{red}{1.82}\\) dollars. \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> We can go directly from 5 apples\r\nto 7 without having to first compute the cost of one apple.\r\nFor that, note that to obtain the final answer we divided the\r\ncost of five  apples by five, then multiplied  by 7. \r\nWe can set up the\r\nproblem as a <dfn>rule of three</dfn>:\r\n\\begin{eqnarray*}\r\n1.3 \\quad ............\\quad 5\\\\\r\n?\\quad  ............\\quad 7\r\n\\end{eqnarray*}\r\nwith the question mark being the cost of 7 apples.  Then\r\nthis cost is obtained by multiplying the number in the \r\nupper left corner by the number in the lower right corner\r\nand then dividing by the number in the upper right corner (which\r\nlies opposite to the question mark):  \r\n\\begin{eqnarray*}\r\n\\frac{1.3}{5}\\times 7=\\frac{1.3\\times 7}{5}.\r\n\\end{eqnarray*}\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThis is how the rule of three works, and here is a second example:\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n<b>Example 2:</b> John's car goes 28 miles on a gallon of gas, and gas costs 1.6 dollars a gallon. \r\nHow many miles can John drive on 20 dollars worth of gas?\r\n<!-- AMC 8, modified -->\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n<b>Solution:</b> Again, you start by noticing that the distance a car travels is proportional to the amount\r\nof gas it uses, and this amount is proportional to its price. This means that with twice the gas you\r\ntravel twice the distance, and with twice the amount of money you can buy twice the amount of gas.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nFrom the statement we see that for 1.6 dollars (the cost of one gallon), \r\nJohn can drive 28 miles.  We set up the rule of three\r\n\\begin{alignat*}{1}\r\n28\\mbox{ miles }\\quad ............&\\quad 1.6\\mbox{ dollars}\\\\\r\n? \\quad ............&\\quad 20\\mbox{ dollars}.\r\n\\end{alignat*}\t\r\nThe value of the question mark is how far John can drive with gas worth 20 dollars.

You cannot\r\nuse the rule of three to answer the question: &ldquo;If it takes me 2 hours to learn the lesson, how\r\nlong will it take the two of us to learn it?&rdquo;  Clearly each of us has to learn the lesson \r\nseparately, and I still learn it in 2 hours, and it will take you probably 2 hours as well, but we\r\ncan learn it at the same time, so the answer may well be 2 hours. \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nSee if you can apply the rule of three to the following problems:\r\n<p>\r\n<!-- end explanation of theory 1 -->\r\n\r\n\r\n")

While it might be hard to draw  the\r\nobjects from the statement of the problem accurately, you can\r\nalways represent them schematically as boxes, segments, disks,...\r\nFor example, a bag of apples can be sketched as a red box.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nYou can keep track of what drawing represents what object by\r\nusing colors. For example Mary's money can be drawn as a red\r\nbox and John's money as a blue box. \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nAlso, to help you reason correctly, you should represent\r\n equal quantities by\r\nthe same geometric object. And you want to represent the\r\nbigger object by the bigger box. So if you have three equal bags\r\nof grains, you draw them as three equal boxes. And if you\r\nhave two amounts of money with the first larger than the second,\r\nyou represent them as two boxes with the first larger than the\r\nsecond, or as two segments with the first longer than the second.\r\nSometimes you cannot compare, then... just make a choice.  \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> \r\nNow all that remains is to play with your drawings. There is\r\nno general scheme, you have to invent your solution. \r\nBut we show you a few examples, followed by very similar problems, to help you strengthen your\r\nskills. \r\n</p> \r\n\r\n<p>\r\n<b>Example:</b> Three bags of wheat weigh together 225 pounds.

Theory.create!(curriculum: 'lifetomath', category: 'applications', context: 'quantities', filename: 'quantitytheory.html', text: "<h3 align=\"left\">Quantities</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nHere is a first series of problems where you apply the methods that \r\nyou were taught. But <b>you</b> have to choose the method.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> The &ldquo;quantities&rdquo; these problems are about \r\nare  <dfn>numbers</dfn> of objects, <dfn>weights</dfn>,  <dfn>sizes</dfn> such as\r\n<dfn>lengths</dfn>, <dfn>surface areas</dfn>, <dfn title=\"the amount of liquid that fills a certain space\">volumes</dfn>, etc. \r\n  First, some facts you need to know.\r\n</p>\r\n \r\n<p>\r\nFor weights we use  both standard systems:\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>the  <dfn>United States customary units</dfn>, where weigths are measured in <dfn>ounces</dfn> and <dfn>pounds</dfn>, with one pound being 16 ounces, and</li>\r\n<li>the <dfn>metric system</dfn>, where where weights\r\nare measured in <dfn>grams</dfn> and <dfn>kilograms</dfn> with one kilogram being 1000 grams.\r\n</ol>\r\nIt might be worth knowing that one ounce is about 28.34 grams. \r\n</p> \r\n\r\n<p>\r\nIn some of the problems below we will use meters and centimeters\r\nto measure lengths (1 meter = 100 centimeters), acres\r\nto measure areas, and gallons to measure volume. \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nHere are some examples, so that you know what to expect. \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p><b>Example 1.</b>\r\nA farmer sold cherries at the market to three buyers.\r\nTo the first buyer, the farmer sold half of the total amount\r\nplus another half a pound, to the second, half of the remaining amount plus another half a pound, and to the third, half of the\r\nremaining quantity and another half a pound. Knowing that \r\nin the end there were 3 pounds of cherries left, find what\r\namount of cherries did the farmer have in the beginning.  \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n<b>Solution:</b>\r\nThis sounds familiar! It reminds us of the method of \r\nworking backwards. We combine this\r\nmethod with some type of  ``false hypothesis'' argument.\r\nWe ask each of the buyers to put the ``half a pound'' back.  Thus, had the third\r\nbuyer not have taken the additional half a pound, the\r\nfarmer would have had left 3.5 pounds. So after the second\r\nbuyer, the farmer had twice that much, that is \\(3.5\\times 2=7\\)\r\npounds. \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nAgain, had the second buyer not have taken the additional half\r\na pound, the farmer would have had left 7.5 pounds. So after\r\nthe first buyer the farmer had \\(7.5\\times 2=15\\) pounds.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nAnd once more, had the first buyer not have taken the additional\r\nhalf a pound, the farmer would have had left 15.5 pounds. So\r\noriginally the farmer had twice this much, that is \\(15.5\\times 2=\\color{red}{31}\\) pounds. \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p><b>Example 2.</b>\r\nIf 10 bananas and 3 cantaloupes weigh as much as 646 cherries, \r\nand one cantaloupe weighs as much as 8 bananas, then one banana weighs as much as how many cherries?\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p><b>Solution:</b>\r\nUsing the comparison method,  we trade cantaloupes for bananas.\r\nOne cantaloupe weighs as much as 8 bananas, so 3 cantaloupes\r\nweigh as much as 24 bananas. Thus \\(24+10=34\\) bananas\r\nweigh as much as 646 cherries. It follows that one banana\r\nweighs as much as \\(\\frac{646}{34}=\\color{red}{19}\\) cherries. \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nHere is a problem that just tests the ability of working with\r\nfractions. \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p><b>Example  3.</b>\r\nThe rancher's son told his father: &ldquo;If we had 99 less\r\nsheep and 39 less goats, then the sheep would be \\(\\frac{5}{11}\\)\r\nof the total number of animals, but if we had 16 more sheep\r\nand 99 more goats, then the sheep would be \\(\\frac{6}{13}\\) of\r\nthe total number of animals.&rdquo; To this the father replied:\r\n&ldquo;Your mathematics is quite bad, you should study more!&rdquo;\r\nWhy did the father reply this way?\r\n<p>\r\n\r\n<!--Russian Math Olympiad-->\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>Solution:</b>\r\nThe </a> father replied this way because <font color=\"red\">the situation described by the son is \r\nimpossible</font>. The number of sheep that is added \r\nbetween the moment that they make \\(\\frac{5}{11}\\) of the total\r\nnumber of animals and the moment they make \\(\\frac{6}{13}\\) of\r\nthe total number of animals is \\(99+16=115\\), while\r\nthe total number of animals grows by  \\(99+16+39+99=253\\).\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nIn lowest terms, the fraction \r\n\\(\\frac{115}{235}\\) is equal to \\(\\frac{5}{11}\\), that is because\r\n\\(115=5\\times 23\\) and \\(235=11\\times 23\\). \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nIn the first instance, the ratio of sheep to all animals\r\n is \\(\\frac{5}{11}\\). \r\nTo the numerator we add 115 and to the denominator we add\r\n235, and \r\n\\begin{eqnarray*}\r\n\\frac{115}{235}=\\frac{5}{11}.\r\n\\end{eqnarray*}\r\nA property of fractions says that if two fractions are\r\nequal and if we add  their  numerators and their denominators, we get a fraction that is also equal to the two fractions.  \r\n For example\r\n\\begin{eqnarray*}\r\n\\frac{3}{5}=\\frac{12}{20}\\mbox{ and }\\frac{3+12}{5+20}=\\frac{15}{25}=\\frac{3}{5}.\r\n\\end{eqnarray*}\r\nSo in our case, in the second instance the ratio of sheep\r\nto all animals should also have been  \\(\\frac{5}{11}\\) and\r\n <b>cannot</b> be \\(\\frac{6}{13}\\). And so the rancher's son <font color=\"red\">made\r\na computational mistake.</font> \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nAnd here is a problem about lenghts.  \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p><b>Example 4.</b>\r\nA pine tree that is 5 years old is 125 centimeters tall. From that moment on, the tree\r\ngrows by \\(\\frac{1}{5}\\) of its size every year. How tall will the tree be when it is 5 years old? \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n<b>Solution:</b>\r\nA centimeter is a unit of length about the width of a finger.\r\nBut you don't need to know that in order to solve the problem.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> \r\nThe best way to understand what happens during  one year\r\nis to use the graphical method and draw the tree as\r\na vertical segment. Divide this segment into five parts.\r\n</p> \r\n<img src=\"/FIGS/pinetree1.gif\" alt=\"The pine tree\"  width=\"10\" height=\"200\"><br>\r\n<p> \r\nThen\r\nduring one year you add one more segment.\r\n</p> \r\n<img src=\"/FIGS/pinetree2.gif\" alt=\"The growth of the pine tree\"  width=\"100\" height=\"250\"><br>\r\n<p> \r\nNow you have 6 segments, so the tree is \\(\\frac{6}{5}\\) times\r\ntaller. In two years the tree will be \\(\\frac{6}{5}\\) times\r\ntaller than in one year, and so it will be \\(\\frac{6}{5}\\times \\frac{6}{5}=\\frac{36}{25}\\) times taller than now.

The word <dfn>per</dfn> means through or during in latin. \r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nKilometers per hour is written shortly as  <dfn title=\"the slash plays the role of the word per\">km/h</dfn>,\r\n so 30 km/h means\r\n30 kilometers per hour.\r\n Miles per hour is written shortly as <dfn title=\"m=miles, p=per, h=hour\">mph</dfn>.\r\n</p>\r\n<p> Traveling at constant speed means that your speed is always\r\nthe same.

Also a speed of 10 meters per minute is  \r\na speed of \\(10\\times 60=600\\) meters per hour. This is the same\r\nas .6 km/h, because 1 meter is .001 kilometers. \r\n</p> \r\n\r\n\r\nWe start with a few examples as a warm up. While none of these examples\r\nwill be repeated in the problems that you will have to solve, you should\r\nread them carefully so that you become familiar with this kind of reasoning. \r\n\r\n<p>\r\n<b>Example 1:</b> A car traveled  30 miles at a speed of 36 miles per hour\r\nand then 100 miles at a speed of 60 miles per hour. What was the average speed of the car?   \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<!--Math Competition, Bucharest 1974-->\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n<b>Solution:</b> The average speed is obtained as the total distance traveled \r\ndivided by the total time. It is clear what the total distance is:\r\n\\begin{eqnarray*}\r\n30+100=130 \\mbox{ miles}. \r\n\\end{eqnarray*}\r\nBut what is the total time?\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n We can compute separately the time it took for\r\nthe car to travel the  30 miles at 36 mph. This time is \r\n\\begin{eqnarray*}\r\n\\frac{30}{36}=\\frac{5}{6}\\mbox{ hours}. \r\n\\end{eqnarray*} \r\nIn the same way, the time it took the car to travel the \r\n100 miles traveled at 60 mph is\r\n\\begin{eqnarray*}\r\n\\frac{100}{60}=\\frac{10}{6}\\mbox{ hours}\r\n\\end{eqnarray*}\r\nSo the total duration of the trip is \r\n\\begin{eqnarray*}\r\n\\frac{5}{6}+\\frac{10}{6}=\\frac{15}{6}=\\frac{5}{2}\\mbox{ hours}.\r\n\\end{eqnarray*}\r\nNow we divide the distance by the time to obtain the average velocity as \r\n\\begin{eqnarray*}\r\n\\frac{130}{\\frac{5}{2}}=\\frac{260}{5}=\\color{red}{52}\\mbox{ miles per hour}.\r\n\\end{eqnarray*}\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n<b>Example 2:</b> A biker travels a given distance at constant speed\r\nin some period of time. If the biker were to slow down by 5 km/h, then the same\r\ndistance would be  traveled in twice the time. \r\nWhat is the speed of the biker?   \r\n</p> \r\n\r\n<p>\r\n<b>Solution:</b> Because \r\n\\begin{eqnarray*}\r\n\\mbox{speed}=\\frac{\\mbox{distance}}{\\mbox{time}},\r\n\\end{eqnarray*}\r\nthe time  is inversely proportional with the speed. This means that \r\nthe distance traveled in twice the time is traveled at half the speed.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nSo if we decrease the speed by 5 km/h, it becomes half of what it was.\r\nWhat number becomes half of itself when subtracting 5? To get half of\r\nthe number, you should subtract the other half, so half of the number is\r\n5. Thus the number is \\(2\\times 5=10\\) so the speed of the biker\r\nis <font color=\"red\">10</font> kilometers per hour.   \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n<b>Example 3:</b> The distances traveled by two cars with constant velocities\r\nare proportional to the numbers \\(\\frac{3}{4}\\) and \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\). The cars left at the\r\nsame time, and when the second reached its destination, the first still had to travel\r\n93 kilometers.  \r\nIf the first car did 25% of its trip in one hour and a half \r\nand the second did half of its trip in two hours and fifteen minutes, find the velocities  of the two cars.   \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n<b>Solution:</b> \r\nFirst, let us convert one hour and a half into 90 minutes, and two hours and twenty minutes into\r\n140 minutes.  \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThe next step is a reduction to the unit. \r\nBecause 25% is \\(\\frac{1}{4}\\), the first car traveled its entire distance in\r\n\\(4\\times 90 = 360 \\) minutes. \r\nIn the same way, because the second car traveled half of the distance in 135 minutes, it\r\n traveled its entire distance in \\(2\\times 135=270\\)\r\nminutes. \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nFrom here we see that when the second car reached its destination, the first still had to travel 360-270=90\\) minutes.\r\nIn the remaining 90 minutes the first car traveled 93 kilometers, meaning that its velocity is \r\n\\begin{eqnarray*}\r\n\\frac{93}{90}=\\frac{31}{30} \\mbox{ kilometers per minute}. \r\n\\end{eqnarray*}\r\nConverting this into kilometers per hour, we obtain \r\n\\begin{eqnarray*}\r\n\\frac{31\\times 60}{30}=\\color{red}{62} \\mbox{ km/h}.\r\n\\end{eqnarray*}\r\nThis is the velocity of the first car. \r\n</p>\r\n\r\nNext, let us find the distance traveled by the first car. At a velocity of \\(\\frac{31}{30}\\) kilometers per minute,\r\nin 360 minutes the first car traveled \\(\\frac{31}{30}\\times 360=372\\) kilometers. \r\nWe know that the distances traveled by the two cars are proportional with the numbers \\(\\frac{3}{4}\\) and\r\n\\(\\frac{1}{2}=\\frac{1}{4}\\). We represent the two distances graphically in the following way. First we start with one reference segment. \r\n</p>\r\n<img src=\"/FIGS/twocars1.gif\" alt=\"The reference segment for the two distances\"  width=\"200\" height=\"10\"><br>\r\n<p>\r\nNow we divide this segment into 4 parts, so that we can measure \r\n\\(\\frac{3}{4}\\) and \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) with the pieces. \r\n</p>\r\n<img src=\"/FIGS/twocars2.gif\" alt=\"The reference segment for the two distances divided into four parts\"  width=\"200\" height=\"10\"><br>\r\n<p>\r\nThe distance traveled by the first car can be represented as\r\n3 pieces of the reference segment, the distance traveled by the\r\nsecond car can be represented as 2 pieces:\r\n</p>\r\n<img src=\"/FIGS/twocars3.gif\" alt=\"The distances traveled by the two cars\"  width=\"200\" height=\"90\"><br>\r\n<p>\r\nThen one piece is \\(\\frac{372}{3}=124\\) kilometers, and so the distance traveled by the second car\r\nis \\(2\\times 124=248\\) kilometers. This was done in 270 minutes, so the velocity of the second car is\r\n\\begin{eqnarray*}\r\n\\frac{248}{270}\\mbox{ kilometers per minute}. \r\n\\end{eqnarray*}\r\nWe convert this into kilometers per hour to obtain that the velocity of the second car \r\nis\r\n\\begin{eqnarray*}\r\n\\frac{248\\times 60}{270}=\\frac{496}{9}=\\color{red}{55\\frac{1}{9}} \\mbox{ km/h}.\r\n\\end{eqnarray*}\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n")

So 50% means\r\n50 parts in 100, that is \\(\\frac{50}{100}\\) of the total amount.\r\nSaying 50% is the same as saying one half. \r\nIf we say that 2.5% of a group of 200 people like mathematics, we\r\nmean that \r\n\\begin{eqnarray*}\r\n\\frac{2.5}{100}\\times 200=\\frac{25}{1000}\\times 200=5\\mbox{ people}\r\n\\end{eqnarray*}\r\nlike mathematics. \r\n</p>\r\nThe word percent comes from the latin expression <i>per centum</i>, which means, in latin, <i>in one hundred</i>.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nFor most of the problems you should just convert the percentage\r\ninto a fraction of the total amount. Here is an example:\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p><b>Example 1:</b> The number of apples that I have represents 25% of the numbers of apples that you have.\r\nWhat percentage does the number of apples that you have represent of the total number\r\nof apples that we have together?\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n<b>Solution:</b> \r\n\tThis is the graphical solution.\r\nLet us draw my number of apples as one box. Since this is 25% of your number of apples,\r\nyour apples should be represented by 4 boxes. Together we have 5 boxes of apples. \r\nOf these, your 4 boxes represent 4/5, that is <font color=\"red\">80%</font>.\r\n</p> \r\n<img src=\"/FIGS/applepercent.gif\" alt=\"The boxes of apples\"  width=\"180\" height=\"80\"><br>\r\n<p> \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nPercentage plays an important role in expressing the concentration of solutions.

So if the bottle contains\r\n16 fluid ounces of Distilled Vinegar, then only \\(\\frac{1}{20}\\)th of that, namely \\(\\frac{16}{20}=.8\\) fluid ounces are\r\nthe actual vinegar. \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> <b>Example 2:</b>\r\nMary and Jane have each a bottle of juice of the same size.\r\nThen Mary gives Jane 12% of what she has.

Will Mary\r\nend up having more or less juice than Jane?\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p><b>Solution:</b>\r\nThis is just a computationally intensive problem. After the first step Mary will have 88% of a bottle,\r\nwhile Jane will have 112%. Then Jane gives Mary 11% of what she\r\nhas, which is \\(112\\times \\frac{11}{100}=12.32\\) percent of a bottle. Thus after the second step Mary has \\(88+12.32=100.32\\) \r\npercent of a bottle. \r\n\r\nNext Mary gives Jane \\(100.32\\times \\frac{10}{100}=10.032\\) percent of a bottle. Now Mary has \\(100.32-10.032=90.288\\) percent of a bottle, and Jane has  \\(100+(100-90.288)=109.712\\) percent of a bottle. Jane gives Mary 9% of what she has, that is\r\n\\(109.712\\times \\frac{9}{10}=9.87408\\) percent of a bottle.\r\n Since she started with  109.712% of a bottle and she drops 9.87% of a bottle, she will now\r\nhave less than 100%, which means that Mary ends up having\r\nmore that 100% of a bottle.

When you buy something you\r\ngive money, when you sell something you are receive money in\r\nreturn.  The amount of money that you pay for an object is\r\nthe <dfn>cost</dfn> of that object, this is how much the object is worth. The cost of several objects of the same kind is \r\nproportional with the number of objects. For example\r\nif one pound of  apples costs 3 dollars, then 2 pounds of apples\r\ncost 6 dollars, 3 pounds of apples cost 9 dollars and so on.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nWhen you work for someone, you recieve money in return. This\r\nis the money that you <dfn>earn</dfn>. The money\r\nthat you earn depends on what type of work you do, and it\r\nis proportional to the amount of work. \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nEvery country has its own money, called <dfn>currency</dfn>. For example United States\r\nhas <dfn>dollars</dfn>, China has <dfn>yuan</dfn>, Romania has <dfn>lei</dfn>, and several European\r\ncountries have <dfn>euros</dfn>.\r\nThe dollar is denoted by <dfn>$</dfn>, for example 100 dollars is written as $100.\r\n\r\n <p>\r\nIn most countries one unit of its own money is further divided.\r\nFor example \r\n1 dollar is divided into <dfn>100 cents</dfn>, \r\n1 euro is divided into <dfn>100 euro cents</dfn>, 1 Romanian leu is divided into <dfn>100 bani</dfn>. \r\nIn all our problems, the unit of the currency is\r\ndivided into exactly 100 smaller parts, but these parts are no\r\nlonger divided.  So you can have a price of 1.36 dollars, which\r\nis one dollar and 36 cents, but you cannot have a price of 1.365 dollars, as you cannot divide one cent in half.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nMoney comes as <dfn title=\"made out of paper\">bills</dfn>  or <dfn title=\"made out of paper\">coins</dfn>.\r\nThe value of a bill or coin is called its <dfn>denomination</dfn>.\r\n</p> \r\n\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nWhen traveling from one country to another, you have to\r\nto change from one type of money to another. For example\r\nwhen you travel from the United States to Mexico, you bring\r\nsome US dollars with you and you exchange them in Mexico for \r\nMexican pesos.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nHere is a warmup problem. \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p><b>Example 1.</b>\r\nThree students were awarded  scholaships in the total amount of 1520 dollars.

The first student received \\(\\frac{5}{4}\\) times the amount of money\r\nreceived by the second, and the third received \\(\\frac{73}{52}\\)\r\ntimes the amount received by the second student. \r\n\r\nWithout actually drawing them, we can imagine the\r\namount of money received by the second student as \r\nrepresented by 52 boxes. Then the amount of money of\r\nthe first student is \\(\\frac{5\\times 52}{4}=65\\) boxes and\r\nof the third student is \\(73\\) boxes. Altogether they\r\nreceived \\(65+52+73=190\\) boxes. So one box is\r\nworth \\(\\frac{1520}{90}=8\\) dollars. \r\nWe conclude that  the first student received\r\n\\(65\\times 8=\\color{red}{520}\\) dollars, the second student received \\(52\\times 8=\\color{red}{416}\\) dollars\r\nand the third student received \\(73\\times 8=\\color{red}{584}\\) dollars. \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nAnd here is a more challenging problem.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n<b>Example 2.</b> A store mixed brown rice that it bought at\r\n \\(3\\) dollars a pound \r\nwith black rice that it bought at \\(5\\) dollars a pound, obtaining 36 pounds of\r\nmix. What amount of each type did they buy knowing that\r\nby selling it at 4.60  dollars a pound they made a profit of 17.60 dollars? \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n<b>Solution:</b> Using the method of false hypothesis, \r\nlet us assume that the store did not buy any black rice.\r\nThen by selling the 36 pounds at 4.60 dollars a pound,\r\nthey have earned \\(36\\times 4.60=165.60\\) dollars, exceeding\r\nthe \\(36\\times 3= 108\\) dollars paid for it by\r\n\\(165.60-108=57.60\\) dollars. This is by \r\n\\(57.60-17.60=40\\) more than the actual profit, and\r\nthe difference comes from the black rice. \r\nFor every pound of black rice that replaces brown rice, 2 dollars are added to the cost. So to obtain the 40 dollars\r\ndifference, we need to replace \\(\\frac{40}{2}=20\\) \r\npounds of brown  rice by black rice. Thus the store\r\nhas bought \\(\\color{red}{20}\\) pounds of\r\nblack rice and   \\(36-20=\\color{red}{16}\\) pounds \r\nof brown rice. \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n")

What is the temperature of\r\nthe mixture?\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n<b>Solution:</b> \r\nEach liter of water contributes the same, so the first liter \r\ncontributes 12 &#x2103;, the second contributes 12 &#x2103;, \r\nthe third contributes 32 &#x2103;, the fourth 32 &#x2103;,\r\nand the fifth 32 &#x2103;. The average temperature is\r\nthen \r\n\\begin{eqnarray*}\r\n\\frac{12+12+32+32+32}{5}=\\frac{24+96}{5}=\\frac{120}{5}=\\color{red}{24}\\mbox{ &#x2103;}.\r\n\\end{eqnarray*}\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p><b>Example 2:</b>\r\nBeatrix drove on a road for 5 hours at 60 km/h, and for 3 hours\r\nat 50 km/h. What was her relative speed?\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n<b>Solution:</b> Beatrix drove \r\n\\begin{eqnarray*}\r\n5\\times 60+3\\times 50=450 \\mbox{ km}\r\n\\end{eqnarray*}\r\nin \\(5+3=8\\) hours. Her average speed was\r\n\\begin{eqnarray*}\r\n\\frac{450}{8}=\\color{red}{56.25 }\\mbox{ km/h}.\r\n\\end{eqnarray*}\r\nBut we can argue differently, using the metod of false hypothesis. If for the entire duration of the trip the\r\nspeed had been 50 km/h, then the average speed itself\r\n would have\r\nbeen 50 km/h.

It is probably the most powerful tool\r\never to be introduced to mathematics. In order to understand how this tool works, let us look at an example.  \r\n\r\n<p><b>Example 1:</b>\r\nJohnny was told to buy strawberries and peaches to make juice for a party. \r\nHe was told to buy 30 pounds of fruit, and there should 3 times more peaches than strawberries.\r\nWhat quantity of peaches did he buy? \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p><b>Solution:</b>\r\nWe can represent the amount of strawberries as one box, and \r\nthen the quantity of peaches should be 3 boxes. In total\r\nwe have 4 equal boxes representing all the fruit, and this\r\nstands for 30 pounds of fruit. So one box stands for \\(\\frac{30}{4}=7.5\\) pounds, and so Johnny bought \\(7.5\\times 3=\\color{red}{22.5}\\) pounds of peaches.   \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThere is no need to draw anything. We can replace a box with the letter  \\(x\\),  and this is  the \r\nquantity of strawberries. The  quantity of peaches consists\r\nof three \\(x\\)s, namely of  \\(3x\\). So altogether we have\r\n\\(3x+x=4x\\), which stands for the total quantity of fruit. That\r\n4 boxes stand for 30 pounds can be written algebraically as:\r\n \\begin{eqnarray*}\r\n4x=30.\r\n\\end{eqnarray*}\r\nIt is like we have a scale, on one side we have 4 boxes (or 4 \\(x\\)s) and on the other side we have 30 pounds of fruit, and the \r\nscale is even. Then a single \\(x\\) is \\(\\frac{1}{4}\\) of the 30 pounds, that is \\(x=\\frac{30}{4}=7.5\\). This is how many\r\nstrawberries Johnny bought, and he bought 3 times that many\r\npeaches, that is \\(3x=3\\times 7.5=\\color{red}{22.5}\\) pounds of\r\npeaches (note that here we know that \\(x\\) stands for 7.5 pounds).    \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nBut algebra is more powerful than what we just saw. We are supposed to find the\r\nnumber of peaches, so  let us denote\r\nthe number of peaches be \\(x\\). \r\nWe start by relating everything else to \\(x\\). The\r\nnumber of strawberries is one third of \\(x\\), that is \r\n\\(\\frac{x}{3}\\). The total amount  of fruit is now\r\n\\begin{eqnarray*}\r\n\\frac{x}{3}+x=\\frac{x}{3}+\\frac{3x}{3}=\\frac{x+3x}{3}=\\frac{4x}{3}.\r\n\\end{eqnarray*} \r\nThis should be equal to 30 so we have the equality\r\n\\begin{eqnarray*}\r\n\\frac{4x}{3}=30.\r\n\\end{eqnarray*}\r\nMultiply both sides by 3 and divide both by 4 to obtain\r\n\\begin{eqnarray*}\r\nx=\\frac{30\\times 3}{4}=\\frac{90}{4}=\\color{red}{22.5}\\mbox{ pounds}.\r\n\\end{eqnarray*}\r\nAnd this is why we like algebra! It is so much easier\r\nto work with letters and numbers than with boxes and segments. \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nIt is customary to use \\(x\\) for the <dfn>unknown</dfn>\r\n (they even do it in names, for example the Spanish conquerors wrote Mexico, because they  did not recognize the Aztec sound that \\(x\\) replaces). \r\nBut you can use any letter you wish for the unknown, such\r\nas the initial letter of the word: \\(t\\) for time,\r\n\\(v\\) for <dfn title=\"this is the fancy word for speed\">velocity</dfn>. Other common letters: \\(y,z\\); or \\(m,n,k\\) if the \r\nunknown is a <dfn title=\"integer\">whole</dfn> number such as the\r\nnumber of students in one classroom. \r\n</p>\r\n\r\nLet us get back to examples, with one that we have already  encountered\r\nas a problem in the section about motion. \r\n\r\n\r\n<p><b>Example 2:</b>\r\nPierre travels from the city to his vacation\r\nhouse in the countryside. One third of the time he\r\ntravels on the freeway at 120 km/h and the rest  of the\r\ntime he  travels on a country road at  80 km/h.\r\nKnowing that the distance Pierre has traveled on the country road\r\nexceeds  the distance he has traveled on the freeway by 60 km,\r\nfind the total distance Pierre has traveled.  \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n<b>Solution:</b>\r\nA possible solution without using algebra has already been shown before: \r\n\r\n<p>\r\nRepresent the distance traveled on the country road in\r\n\\(\\frac{1}{3}\\) of the time by one segment. Then in\r\n\\(\\frac{2}{3}\\) of the time Pierre traveled two segments. \r\nThis is what he traveled on the country road. Then on\r\nthe freeway, at 120 km/h he traveled one segment (for \r\n80 km/h) plus another half of a segment (for the additional 40 km/h). So he traveled one segment and a half on the freeway. Cutting the original segment in half, we have the following \r\nsituation:\r\n</p> \r\n<img src=\"/FIGS/pierre.gif\" alt=\"The meeting point of the car and the van\"  width=\"500\" height=\"80\"><br>\r\nLooking at the figure we see that the distance traveled on\r\nthe country road has one additonal segment, and we are told\r\nthat the length of this segment is 60 kilometers. \r\nThe total distance is made out of 7 segments, so it is\r\nequal to \\(7\\times 60=\\color{red}{420}\\) kilometers. \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nWe can turn this into algebra by denoting the distance traveled on the country road in\r\n\\(\\frac{1}{6}\\) of the time by \\(x\\). Then on the freeway\r\nhe traveled \\(3x\\) kilometers, and on the country road \\(4x\\) kilometers. \r\nThus on the country road he traveled \\(4x-3x=x\\) more kilometers,\r\nand thus \\(x=60\\) kilometers. And in total Pierre traveled\r\n\\(3x+4x=7x=7\\times 60=\\color{red}{420}\\) kilometers.  \r\n</p> \r\n\r\n<p> This algebraic solution still uses the intuition that\r\nwe gained from the graphical method. \r\n But algebra gives us more flexibility. We can use\r\nother elements in the problem for the unknowns. In the context\r\nof this problem, it is more natural to  work with unknown \\(t\\) that represents the number of hours\r\nit takes Pierre to reach his vacation home. Then\r\nhe travels \\( \\frac{1}{3}t\\) hours\r\non the freeway and \\(\\frac{2}{3}t\\) hours\r\non the country road. Since distance is velocity times time,\r\nPierre travels \r\n\\begin{eqnarray*}\r\n120\\times \\frac{1}{3}t=40t\\mbox{ kilometers}\r\n\\end{eqnarray*} on\r\nthe freeway and\r\n\\begin{eqnarray*}\r\n80\\times \\frac{2}{3}t=\\frac{160}{3}t\\mbox{ kilometers}\r\n\\end{eqnarray*} \r\n\r\n\r\n The fact that he travels\r\n60 miles more on the country road than on the freeway translates\r\ninto\r\n\\begin{eqnarray*}\r\n40t+60=\\frac{160}{3}t,\r\n\\end{eqnarray*} \r\nso\r\n\\begin{eqnarray*}\r\n\\frac{40}{3}t=60.\r\n\\end{eqnarray*}\r\nIt follows that the total time traveled is \r\n\\begin{eqnarray*}\r\nt=60\\times \\frac{3}{40}=\\frac{9}{2}\\mbox{ hours}.\r\n\\end{eqnarray*}\r\nThus Pierre traveled 4 and a half hours.\r\nThe time he traveled on the freeway is\r\n\\begin{eqnarray*}\r\n \\frac{9}{2}\\times \\frac{1}{3}=\\frac{3}{2}\\mbox{ hours} \r\n\\end{eqnarray*}\r\nso the distance traveled on the freeway is \r\n\\begin{eqnarray*}\r\n\\frac{3}{2}\\times 120=180\\mbox{ kilometers}.\r\n\\end{eqnarray*}\r\nWe also know that the distance traveled on the country\r\nroad is by 60 kilometers more than that, that is \\(180+60=240\\) kilometers. So the total distance is\r\n\\begin{eqnarray*}\r\n180+240=\\color{red}{420}\\mbox{ kilometers}.\r\n\\end{eqnarray*}\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nHere is another example from the section about motion.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p><b>Example 3:</b> If you drive at 65 kilometers per hour you arrive an hour too late at your destination. If you drive at 90 kilometers \r\nper hour you arrive two hours too early at your destination. How fast\r\nshould you be driving to arrive on time?  \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n<b>Solution:</b> The solution we gave in that section was\r\nquite tricky: \r\n\r\n<p>\r\nIf you have traveled for the required time at 65 kilometers per hour, you\r\nare 65 kilometers short of your destination. If you have traveled for the required time at 90 kilometers per hour, you\r\ntraveled 180 kilometers too much. So the 25 kilometer per  hour\r\nexcess velocity (between 65 and 90 kilometers per hour) allows\r\nyou to cover  precisely \\(180+65=245\\) kilometers. This means\r\nthat the time of your travel is the ratio\r\nof this distance and the velocity, which is\r\n\\begin{eqnarray*}\r\n\\frac{245}{25}=9.8 \\mbox{ hours}.\r\n\\end{eqnarray*}\r\nNow that we know the time, we can find the distance. Since\r\nwe travel \\(9.8-2\\) hours at 90 kilometers per hour to cover this\r\ndistance, the distance is \\(90\\times 7.8=702\\) kilometers.\r\nAnd now the optimal velocity is \r\n\\begin{eqnarray*}\r\n\\frac{702}{9.8}\\approx \\color{red}{ 71.63}\\mbox{ kilometers per hour}.\r\n\\end{eqnarray*}\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> Algebra makes this problem much easier. Here are two approaches:\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n<b>1.</b> \r\nDenote by \\(t\\) the optimal time, that is the number\r\nof hours it takes to arrive on time. Then since the distance\r\nin all situations is the same, and since distance is\r\nvelocity\\(\\times\\)time, we can set up the equality\r\n\\begin{eqnarray*}\r\n65(t+1)=90(t-2).\r\n\\end{eqnarray*} \r\nSo \\(25t=245\\). This gives \\(t=9.8\\) hours. Now we can find the\r\ntotal distance, which is \\(90\\times(9.8-2)=702\\) kilometers. And\r\nthe optimal velocity is this divided by \\(9.8\\) hours \r\n\\begin{eqnarray*}\r\n\\frac{702}{9.8}\\approx \\color{red}{ 71.63}\\mbox{ kilometers per hour}.\r\n\\end{eqnarray*}\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n<b>2.</b>\r\nWe start the solution by making the observation that when traveling the\r\nsame amount of time, the velocity is\r\nproportional to the distance traveled. Let \\(v\\) be the optimal velocity. All the travel below is performed during the time\r\ninterval necessary to reach destination when traveling with velocity \\(v\\). \r\n\r\n When you travel at 65 kilometers per hour, you are one hour away from\r\nthe destination when the required time expires, so you have\r\n65 more kilometers to travel. Thus if you were to travel at velocity\r\n\\(v-65\\) you would cover precisely these 65 kilometers during the\r\nentire duration of the travel. \r\n\r\nFor the same reason, if you travel at 90 kilometers per hour, when the\r\nrequired time expires you have traveled an excess of two hours,\r\nthus you covered an additional \\(2\\times 90=180\\) kilometers. Thus\r\nif you had traveled at velocity \\(90-v\\), you would have covered\r\nprecisely \\(180\\) kilometers. Using the proportionality between\r\nthe \r\nvelocity and the distance, we set up the rule of three as follows:\r\n\\begin{alignat*}{1}\r\nv-65\\quad ............&\\quad \\; 65\\\\\r\n90-v\\quad ............ &\\quad 180.\r\n\\end{alignat*}    \r\nThus \r\n\\begin{eqnarray*}\r\n180(v-65)=65(90-v).\r\n\\end{eqnarray*}\r\nWe separate the \\(v\\) terms on the left and write this as\r\n\\begin{eqnarray*}\r\n180v+65v=90\\times 65+180\\times 65.\r\n\\end{eqnarray*}\r\nHence \r\n\\begin{eqnarray*}\r\n245v=17550.\r\n\\end{eqnarray*}\r\nWe obtain\r\n\\begin{eqnarray*}\r\nv=\\frac{17550}{245}\\approx \\color{red}{ 71.63}\\mbox{ kilometers per hour}.\r\n\\end{eqnarray*}\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p><b>Example 4:</b> A biker went from one town to another. After 40 minutes of travel, \r\nthe biker met a local farmer, who\r\ntold him that the distance he had already biked is by one and a half kilometers less than\r\nwhat he has left and that rain is coming.  So the biker started riding by 1 km/h faster,\r\nand in 45 minutes he reached his destination. What is the distance between the two towns?  \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<!--Gheba-->\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n<b>Solution:</b> Here is the graphical solution that we gave\r\nbefore:\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n We represent the trip graphically, \r\n</p> \r\n<img src=\"/FIGS/traveler1.gif\" alt=\"The biker traveling between two towns\"  width=\"410\" height=\"100\"><br>\r\n<p>\r\nOn this drawing we slowed down the biker by 1 km/h for the second part of the trip, setting\r\nup a new target of the trip 45 minutes away from the point were the biker met the farmer.\r\nBecause the speed is now by 1 km/h less, this point is now  \\(\\frac{3}{4}\\times 1=\\frac{3}{4}\\)\r\nkilometers closer than the original target. But now at least we know that the biker did not\r\nchange pace. \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> We draw a new figure.\r\n</p> \r\n<img src=\"/FIGS/traveler2.gif\" alt=\"The biker traveling between two towns\"  width=\"380\" height=\"80\"><br>\r\n<p>\r\nOn it we notice that the second part of the trip took 5 minutes longer than the first, and was\r\nby \\begin{eqnarray*}\r\n1\\frac{1}{2}-\\frac{3}{4}=\\frac{3}{2}-\\frac{3}{4}=\\frac{3}{4}\r\n\\end{eqnarray*} kilometers longer. So in the last 5 minutes, marked on the drawing as the \r\ndistance between the green point and the red target point, the biker traveled \\(\\frac{3}{4}\\) kilometers. \r\nSince \\(5\\mbox{ minutes} = \\frac{1}{12}\\mbox{ hours}\\), this means that the biker traveled at a speed of \r\n\\begin{eqnarray*}\r\n\\frac{\\frac{3}{4}}{\\frac{1}{12}}=\\frac{36}{4}=9\\mbox{ km/h}.\r\n\\end{eqnarray*}\r\nNow we can compute the distance between the towns. 40 minutes are \\(\\frac{2}{3}\\) of an hour,\r\nso the distance between the first town and the farmer is \r\n\\begin{eqnarray*}\r\n\\frac{9}\\times \\frac{2}{3}=6\\mbox{ kilometers}.\r\n\\end{eqnarray*}\r\nNow we return to the original pace. The last \\(\\frac{3}{4}\\) of an hour are traveled at\r\n\\(9+1=10\\) km/h. So this distance is  \r\n\\begin{eqnarray*}\r\n\\frac{10}\\times \\frac{3}{4}=7.5\\mbox{ kilometers}.\r\n\\end{eqnarray*}\r\nThus the entire distance is \\(7\\frac{1}{2}+6=\\color{red}{13.5}\\) kilometers.  \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> This was quite complicated. Let us see how algebra simplifies\r\nour work. Again, we give two algebraic solutions:\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n<b>1.</b> Let \\(v\\) be the velocity, in kilometers per hour, that the biker had until meeting the farmer. \r\nThen the first part of the road has length \\(\\frac{2}{3}v\\) and the second, being by \\(1\\frac{1}{2}=\\frac{3}{2}\\)\r\nkilometers longer  was \\(\\frac{2}{3}v+\\frac{3}{2}\\), and being traveled at velocity \\(v+1\\) has\r\nalso the length \\(\\frac{3}{4}(v+1)\\). Setting these two formulas equal we obtain\r\n\\begin{eqnarray*}\r\n\\frac{2}{3}v+\\frac{3}{2}=\\frac{3}{4}(v+1).\r\n\\end{eqnarray*}  \r\nWe can transform this into\r\n\\begin{eqnarray*}\r\n\\left(\\frac{3}{4}-\\frac{2}{3}\\right)v=\\frac{3}{2}-\\frac{3}{4},\r\n\\end{eqnarray*}\r\nthat is\r\n\\begin{eqnarray*}\r\n\\frac{1}{12}v=\\frac{3}{4}.\r\n\\end{eqnarray*}\r\nThus \\(v=9\\) km/h. The entire trip will then have the length\r\n\\begin{eqnarray*}\r\n\\frac{2}{3}v+\\frac{3}{4}(v+1)=6+\\frac{15}{2}=\\frac{27}{2}=\\color{red}{13.5}\\mbox{ kilometers}. \r\n\\end{eqnarray*}\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p><b>2.</b> We start the second solution by observing that \r\n\\(40\\) minutes are \\(\\frac{2}{3}\\) of an hour, \\(45\\) minutes are \\(\\frac{3}{4}\\) of an hour, and \r\nthe distance from the midpoint of the road to where the traveler is after \\(\\frac{2}{3}\\) of an hour\r\nis\r\n\\begin{eqnarray*}\r\n\\frac{1\\frac{1}{2}}{2}=\\frac{3}{4}\\mbox{ kilometers}. \r\n\\end{eqnarray*}\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We use as the unknown \\(x\\) the distance between the two towns. \r\nThen the distance between the farmer and the first village is\r\n\\begin{eqnarray*}\r\n\\frac{x}{2}-\\frac{3}{4}=\\frac{2x-3}{4},\r\n\\end{eqnarray*}\r\nand the distance between the farmer and the second village is \r\n\\begin{eqnarray*}\r\n\\frac{x}{2}+\\frac{3}{4}=\\frac{2x+3}{4}. \r\n\\end{eqnarray*}\r\nThe first part of the road is traveled with a velocity of\r\n\\begin{eqnarray*}\r\n\\frac{\\frac{2x-3}{4}}{\\frac{2}{3}}=\\frac{3(2x-3)}{8}=\\frac{6x-9}{8}\\mbox{ km/h},\r\n\\end{eqnarray*}\r\nand the second at\r\n\\begin{eqnarray*}\r\n\\frac{\\frac{2x+3}{4}}{\\frac{3}{4}}=\\frac{2x+3}{3}\\mbox{ km/h}.\r\n\\end{eqnarray*}\r\nThe second velocity is by 1 km/h greater than the first, so we obtain the system of\r\nequations\r\n\\begin{eqnarray*}\r\n\\frac{6x-9}{8}+1=\\frac{2x+3}{3}.\r\n\\end{eqnarray*}\r\nMultiply both sides by \\(3\\times 8=24\\) to obtain\r\n\\begin{eqnarray*}\r\n18 x-27+24=16x+24. \r\n\\end{eqnarray*}\r\nThus \\(2x=27\\) and so \\(x=\\color{red}{\\frac{27}{2}}=\\color{red}{13.5}\\) kilometers.  \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n")

Remember that \\(x\\) is\r\nan unknown quantity, it can be a number of objects, a\r\nvolume, a percentage, an age, and so on. \r\n\r\n<ol> \r\n\r\n<li> You can add \\(x\\) to another quantity of the same type.\r\nFor example if you are 10 years old, and I am \\(x\\) years\r\nolder, then my age is \\(10+x\\). Or if I have 3 pears and\r\n\\(x\\) apples then I have \\(3+x\\) pieces of fruit.\r\nBut be careful, if you are 4 feet tall, and I am \\(x\\) inches\r\ntaller, then my height is not \\(4+x\\) feet, it is \r\n\\(4\\times 12+x\\) inches.\r\n </li>\r\n\r\n<li> You can subtract \\(x\\) from a quantity of the same\r\ntype. For example if I am 49 years old, and my wife\r\nis \\(x\\) years old, then she is \\(49-x\\) years younger.\r\nBy the same logic, you can subtract quantities from \\(x\\). \r\n</li> \r\n\r\n<li> You can multiply \\(x\\) by a number, but the multiplication\r\nshould make sense. If you have \\(x\\) dollars and I have\r\n\\(\\frac{2}{3}\\) of that, than I have \\(\\frac{2}{3}x\\) dollars. You can write this as \\(\\frac{2x}{3}\\) as well. </li>\r\n\r\n<li> You can divide by \\(x\\). If I have filled 2 gigabites\r\nof a flash drive that has total capacity \\(x\\) gigabites, then\r\nI have filled \\(\\frac{2}{x}\\) of the flash drive.  \r\n</li>\r\n\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nWhen we place the = sign between two quantities, this means that\r\nthe quantities are equal, they are the same. When the equality\r\ninvolves the unknown \\(x\\), then the equality  is called an <dfn>equation</dfn>, and the equation is satisfied, meaning that the\r\nequality holds, for that particular value of \\(x\\) that is\r\nrequired by the problem. \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nTo find the value of \\(x\\) that satisfies a given equation\r\nmeans to <dfn>solve</dfn> the equation. We solve an\r\nequation by transforming it into an equality of the form\r\n\\(x=\\)&ldquo;a given number&rdquo;. You have seen examples\r\nabove. To understand what kind of operations you are allowed\r\nto perform, think of the two sides as lying on the pans of a\r\nbalance scale. \r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n\r\n<li> You can add or subtract the same quantity from both sides.</li>\r\n\r\n<li> You can multiply both sides by the same number.

If you have the equality\r\n\\begin{eqnarray*}\r\n\\frac{x+2}{x+5}=\\frac{1}{4}, \r\n\\end{eqnarray*}\r\nthis just means that, on the left side, the top is four times\r\nsmaller than the bottom, which you can also write as\r\n\\begin{eqnarray*}\r\nx+2=\\frac{1}{4}(x+5).\r\n\\end{eqnarray*}\r\nThus you multiplied both sides by \\(x+5\\). \r\n </li>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nNote the use of brackets that allow you to group elements of\r\nthe same type and multiply them simultaneously with a number.\r\nFor example if you have \\(3x\\) apples and I have 25, and\r\nwe double the total amount of apples, the result is \\(2(3x+25)\\),\r\nbut I can double my quantity, you can double yours, and then\r\nput them together, so\r\n\\begin{eqnarray*}\r\n2(3x+25)=2\\times 3x+2\\times 25=6x+50.\r\n\\end{eqnarray*}  \r\n</p>\r\n\r\nNow it is time for the problems. \r\n\r\n</ol>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n")

How\r\nmuch do 4 pineapples cost?\r\n\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n<b>Solution:</b>\r\nLet \\(x\\) be the cost of 1 apple, \\(y\\) the cost of 1 pear\r\nand, \\(z\\) the cost of 1 pineapple. We have the system of\r\nequations\r\n\\begin{alignat*}{1}\r\n10x+15y+7z&=41\\\\\r\n14x+21y+5z&=43.\r\n\\end{alignat*}\r\nFrom this system we cannot compute all three unknowns, \r\nbut we can compute \\(z\\). For that multiply the first equation\r\nby 7 and the second by 5 to obtain \r\n\\begin{alignat*}{1}\r\n70x+105y+49z&=287\\\\\r\n70x+105y+25z&=215\r\n\\end{alignat*}\r\nSubtract the second equation from the first to obtain\r\n\\begin{eqnarray*}\r\n24z=72.\r\n\\end{eqnarray*}\r\nAt this step, the unknowns \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) have dissapeared.\r\nAnd we are left just with the unknown \\(z\\) that we are asked\r\nto find. We obtain \\(z=\\frac{72}{24}=\\color{red}{3}\\) dollars,\r\nwhich is the cost of one pineapple. \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nIn this example we cannot compute\r\n\\(x\\) and \\(y\\) individually, just \\(2x+3y\\) or multiples of\r\nit. Nevertheless, we can eliminate  \\(x\\) and \\(y\\)\r\nwhen solving the problem, and be left with just\r\nthe unknown \\(z\\). This is the idea behind the  problems in\r\nthis section:\r\n write the information from the statement in convenient\r\nform, even if for that you need variables that you are not asked\r\nto find, and then get rid of those additional variables.\r\nWe call the additional variables that are introduced\r\nbut are not supposed to be determined, or cannot be determined,   <dfn title=\"from the latin auxilium which means help\">auxiliary variables</dfn>.  \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nAs the next example shows, auxiliary variables can help us write\r\ndown formulas and perform computations, and then as we proceed,\r\nthey cancel out.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n<b>Example 2:</b> \r\n</p> \r\nI am three times older than you are. When my age will\r\ndouble, how many times older than you\r\nwill I be  at that time?\r\n<p>\r\n<b>Solution:</b>\r\nWe introduce as a variable your age, which we call  \\(a\\). Then my age is \\(3a\\). When my age will\r\ndouble I will be \\(6a\\) years old, so \\(3a\\) years have passed.\r\nAt that time you will be \\(a+3a=4a\\) years old. Then I am \r\n\\begin{eqnarray*}\r\n\\frac{6a}{4a}=\\frac{6}{4}=\\color{red}{1.5} \\mbox{ times older than you}. \r\n\\end{eqnarray*}  \r\nYou see that when computing the ratio of our ages, \\(a\\) cancels. So although we cannot compute \\(a\\), we can use it as an auxiliary unknown in our calculations. \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nHere are two examples about motion\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n<b>Example 3:</b> Two  cars travel the same distance in the same time interval.\r\nThe first car travels \\(\\frac{3}{4}\\) of the distance at 72km/h and the rest at 96 km/h. The second car travels with constant\r\nvelocity the entire distance. What is the velocity of the second car? \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n<b>Solution:</b> Let \\(d\\) be the total distance and \\(v\\) the velocity of\r\nthe second car. Here \\(v\\) is the velocity that we are supposed to find, and \\(d\\) is the auxiliary variable, to be eliminated\r\nlater. \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThe time that it took the first car to\r\ntravel the first  \\(\\frac{3}{4}\\) the distance, at 72 km/h, is \r\n\\begin{eqnarray*}\r\n\\frac{\\frac{3d}{4}}{72}=\\frac{3d}{4\\cdot 72}=\\frac{d}{96}.\r\n\\end{eqnarray*} \r\nSimilarly, the time it took the first car to travel the \r\nsecond half of the distance is  \r\n\\begin{eqnarray*}\r\n\\frac{\\frac{d}{4}}{96}=\\frac{d}{4\\cdot 96}=\\frac{d}{384}.\r\n\\end{eqnarray*} \r\nThe time it took the second car to travel the entire distance is \r\n\\(d/v\\). Since the two cars traveled the distance in the same \r\ntime interval, we have the equality\r\n\\begin{eqnarray*}\r\n\\frac{d}{96}+\\frac{d}{384}=\\frac{d}{v}.\r\n\\end{eqnarray*}\r\nWe do not need to know what \\(d\\) is, because it cancels out!\r\nThus we have the equality\r\n\\begin{eqnarray*}\r\n\\frac{1}{96}+\\frac{1}{384}=\\frac{1}{v}.\r\n\\end{eqnarray*}\r\nThus\r\n\\begin{eqnarray*}\r\n\\frac{5}{384}=\\frac{1}{v}.\r\n\\end{eqnarray*}\r\nWe find that\r\n\\begin{eqnarray*}\r\nv=\\frac{384}{5}=\\color{red}{76.8}\\mbox{ km/h}.\r\n\\end{eqnarray*}\r\n</p>\r\n\r\nLet us revisit the following problem, which looked rather\r\nhard when we first saw it: \r\n\r\n<p>\r\n<b>Example 4:</b> From Fermatville takes off a passenger plane flying towards Newton City at constant speed. \r\nAt exactly the same time, a\r\ncargo plane starts from Newton City towards Fermatville, also\r\nat constant speed but slightly slower than the passenger plane.\r\nAfter 3 hours, the passenger plane happened to be\r\n at exactly half distance between\r\nFermatville and the cargo plane. After how many hours will it\r\nbe at half distance between the cargo plane and Newton City.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<!--S. Tokarev, 1997-1998 Moscow Mathematical Olympiad-->\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n<b>Solution:</b> \r\nFor simplicity, instead of using miles or kilometers, let  us introduce our\r\nown unit of length equal to the distance between the two cities.\r\nLet \\(d\\) be the distance from the passenger plane to\r\nFermatville after 3 hours, which is a fraction of 1=the total distance between the cities. In this solution \\(d\\) is\r\nthe auxiliary variable, to be eliminated.\r\n</>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n Then the distance from the cargo\r\nplane to Fermatville is \\(2d\\), so the cargo plane traveled\r\na distance of \\(1-2d\\). Now we know that the velocities of the\r\nplanes are\r\n\\begin{eqnarray*}\r\n\\frac{d}{3}\\mbox{ and }\\frac{1-2d}{3}.\r\n\\end{eqnarray*} \r\nThen after \\(t\\) hours the passenger plane has traveled a distance\r\nof  \\(\\frac{d}{3}t\\) while the cargo plane had traveled a distance\r\nof  \\(\\frac{1-2d}{3}\\times t\\).

Theory.create!(curriculum: 'lifetomath', category: 'algebraic', context: 'morevar', filename: 'morevartheory1.html', text: "<h3 align=\"left\"> Several variables</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\r\nIf the problem involves several unknowns, rather than\r\nreplacing just one of them by a letter, and then writing\r\nthe other unknowns in terms of this letter, we can replace\r\neach  unknown by letter and then write algebraic relations\r\nfor these letters. Here is an example that you have seen before:\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n<b>Example 1:</b> \r\nA farmer sowed 800 acres of wheat and 600 acres of\r\nsoybeans during  a two week period. During\r\nthe first week the farmer sowed 3 times more wheat than\r\nsoybeans, and during the second week, the farmer sowed\r\n3 times more soybeans than wheat. How many acres of\r\nwheat and how many acres of soybeans did the farmer sow\r\nduring the first week? \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n<b>Solution:</b>\r\nLet \\(x\\) be the number of acres that were sowed with soybeans on the first week, and let \\(y\\) be the number of acres that were sowed with wheat during the second week. Then during\r\nthe first week the farmer sowed \\(3x\\) acres of wheat,\r\nand during the second week the farmer sowed  \\(3y\\) acres of soybeans. \r\n<p> The total surface of wheat that was sowed was \\(3x+y\\), which should be the same as 800 acres, while the total surface of soybeans sowed was \\(x+3y\\) and this should be the same as\r\n600 acres.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n We obtain what is called a <dfn>system of two equations with two unknowns</dfn>\r\n\\begin{eqnarray*}\r\n&&3x+y=800\\\\\r\n&&x+3y=600.\r\n\\end{eqnarray*}\r\nExamining the first equation we see that \\(y\\),  the number of \r\nacres  sowed with wheat during the second week, is by \\(3x\\) less\r\nthan \\(800\\), and we can write this algebraically \\(y=800-3x\\).\r\nWe can now take the first equation and turn wheat into soybeans:\r\n\\begin{eqnarray*}\r\nx+3(800-3x)=600.\r\n\\end{eqnarray*}\r\nThis gives \r\n\\begin{eqnarray*}\r\nx+2400-9x=600,\r\n\\end{eqnarray*}\r\nthat is \r\n\\begin{eqnarray*}\r\n8x=1800.\r\n\\end{eqnarray*}\r\nThus \\(x=\\color{red}{225}\\) acres, which is the surface of soybeans sowed during the first week. The surface of wheat sowed\r\nduring the first week is three times larger, and is\r\n\\(3\\times 225=\\color{red}{675}\\) acres. \r\n\r\n</p>\r\n\r\nHere is another example, with more unknowns. \r\n\r\n<p>\r\n<b>Example 2:</b> 1 apple, 2 pears, and 3 bananas cost\r\n9 dollars, 2 apples, 3 pears, and 1 apples cost 10 dollars,\r\nand 3 apples, 1 pear, and 2 bananas cost 11 dollars. How much\r\ndoes one apple cost? How  much does a pear cost? How much does\r\na banana cost?\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><b>Solution:</b>\r\nHere we have 3 unknowns: the cost of one apple, the cost of one pear, and the cost of one banana. We replace these costs by the \r\nletters \\(x,y,z\\). Then two apples cost \\(2x\\), three apples cost \\(3x\\), two pears cost \\(2y\\), and so on. \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nSo we can write three relations for these unknowns:\r\n\\begin{alignat*}{1}\r\nx+2y+3z&=9\\\\\r\n2x+3y+z&=10\\\\\r\n3x+y+2x&=11.\r\n\\end{alignat*}\r\nWhile there are standard methods to find \\(x,y,z\\), we can\r\nsolve this by observing that in the three relations we have\r\naltogether 6 apples, 6 pears, and 6 bananas, at a total cost of\r\n\\(9+10+11=30\\) dollars. Algebraically, we add the three equations:\r\n\\begin{eqnarray*}\r\n(1+2+3)x+(2+3+1)y+(3+1+2)z=9+10+11.\r\n\\end{eqnarray*}\r\nSo\r\n\\begin{eqnarray*}\r\n6x+6y+6z=30.\r\n\\end{eqnarray*}\r\nWe make each side 6 times smaller (that is we divide each side by 6) and obtain\r\n\\begin{eqnarray*}\r\nx+y+z=5.\r\n\\end{eqnarray*}\r\nSo 1 apple, plus  1 pear, plus 1 banana cost altogether 1 dollar.\r\nBut \r\n\\(x+2y+3z=9\\).\r\nSo the additional 1 pear and 2 bananas cost \\(9-5=4\\) dollars.\r\nAlgebraically we have subtracted the equality \\(x+y+z=5\\) from\r\nthe equality \\(x+2y+3z=9\\), and we obtained \\(y+2z=4\\). \r\nUsing \\(2x+3y+z=10\\) we obtain instead \\(x+2y=5\\), and\r\nwith \\(3x+y+2z=11\\), we obtain \\(2x+z=6\\). So\r\n\\begin{eqnarray*}\r\ny+2z=4\\\\\r\nx+2y=5\\\\\r\n2x+z=6.\r\n\\end{eqnarray*}\r\nNow if 1 pear and 2 bananas cost 4 dollars and 1 apple\r\nand 2 pears cost 5 dollars, putting them together\r\nwe see that 1 apple, 3 pears at 2 bananas cost 9 dollars.\r\nSo \r\n\\begin{eqnarray*}\r\nx+3y+2z=9.\r\n\\end{eqnarray*}\r\nBut \r\n\\begin{eqnarray*}\r\nx+2y+3z=9,\r\n\\end{eqnarray*}\r\nso if we replace a pear by a banana the cost does not change.\r\nThus pears and bananas have the same price. Algebraically:\r\n\\(y=z\\). \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p><b>Example 3:</b>\r\nWhen Julie asked Robert what his age is, he replied: &ldquo;I \r\nhave now twice the age that you had when I was as old as you\r\n are now. And when you will be my age, I will be missing 9 years to be twice\r\nas old as you are now.&rdquo; What is Robert's age?\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n<b>Solution:</b>\r\nA  solution without using algebra we have seen before: \r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThe youngest age that appears in the problem is that of Julie\r\nwhen Robert had the age that she has now. To arrive at Robert's \r\ncurrent age, we must add to that youngest age the difference in the ages of the two (to reach Julie's current age) and then again the \r\ndifference in the ages of the two to reach Robert's. So when we add twice the age difference of the two we double Julie's age\r\nwhen Robert had the age that she has now. So at that time\r\nJulie's age was twice the difference in their ages. \r\nThus Julie's current age is three times the difference in their ages and Robert's is four times the difference in their ages.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nBy the time Julie will be Robert's current age, their ages will have increased to four times the difference in their ages (for Julie) and five times this difference (for Robert). Add 9 to Robert's age and you get twice Julie's age at the time of the discussion, that is twice three times the difference in ages.\r\nSo five times the difference in ages plus 9 gives \\(2\\times 3=6\\) the difference in their ages. Hence the difference in their ages is 9 years. Robert age is four times that, which is\r\n\\(4\\times 9=\\color{red}{36}\\) years.  \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nLet us solve the problem using algebra.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n<b>1.</b> \r\n For a first approach, let \\(x\\) be Robert's age, and let \\(y\\) be Julie's age. When Robert was Julie's age, her\r\nage was \r\n\\begin{eqnarray*}\r\ny-(x-y)=y-x+y=2y-x,\r\n\\end{eqnarray*} \r\nbecause the difference in age between the two of them is \\(x-y\\). So\r\n\\begin{eqnarray*}\r\nx=2(2y-x).\r\n\\end{eqnarray*}\r\nMultiplying out and moving all terms to the left we obtain\r\n\\begin{eqnarray*}\r\n3x-4y=0.\r\n\\end{eqnarray*}\r\nOn the other hand, when Julie will be Robert's age, he will be \r\n\\begin{eqnarray*}\r\nx+(x-y)=2x-y.\r\n\\end{eqnarray*}\r\nSo\r\n\\begin{eqnarray*}\r\n2x-y+9=2y,\r\n\\end{eqnarray*}\r\nwhich gives, after moving \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) to the left and subtracting 9 from both sides, \r\n\\begin{eqnarray*}\r\n2x-3y=-9.\r\n\\end{eqnarray*}\r\nThus we have to solve the system of two equations with two unknowns\r\n\\begin{eqnarray*}\r\n\\left\\{\r\n\\begin{array}{l}\r\n3x-4y=0\\\\\r\n2x-3y=-9.\r\n\\end{array}\r\n\\right.\r\n\\end{eqnarray*}\r\nSubtracting the equations we obtain \\(x-y=9\\), thus \\(x=y+9\\).\r\nSubstituting in the second equation we obtain\r\n\\begin{eqnarray*}\r\n2(y+9)-3y=-9,\r\n\\end{eqnarray*}\r\nThat is \\(-y+18=-9\\), which gives \\(y=27\\). Thus Julie is 27 years old. Since \\(x-y=9\\), Robert is 9 years older, so his age is \\(27+9=\\color{red}{36}\\) years. \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n<b>2.</b> Because the difference in age between Robert and Julie plays\r\nan important role in the problem use it as one of the unknowns and  it by \\(d\\). Let Julie's age at the time of the discussion be \\(a\\). At that time Robert's age is \\(a+d\\).  Julie's age \\(d\\) years ago (when Robert was her age) was \\(a-d\\). Thus we have\r\n\\begin{eqnarray*}\r\na+d=2(a-d)=2a-2d.\r\n\\end{eqnarray*}\r\n  Thus \\(a=3d\\).\r\nOn the other hand, when Julie will be Robert's age, he will be \\(d\\) years older, that is \\(a+d+d=a+2d\\). Add to that 9 years\r\nto get twice the age Julie is at the time of the discussion. Thus\r\n\\begin{eqnarray*}\r\na+2d+9=2a.\r\n\\end{eqnarray*}\r\nWe obtain \\(a=2d+9\\). Combining this with \\(a=3d\\) we obtain \r\n\\(2d+9=a=3d\\) so \\(3d-2d=9\\) and hence \\(d=9\\). But then Robert's age is \r\n\\begin{eqnarray*}\r\na+d=3d+d=4d=4\\times 9=\\color{red}{36} \\mbox{ years}.\r\n\\end{eqnarray*}\r\nThis solution is simpler so it does matter how we choose the unknowns!\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nHere is another example from the section about motion.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p><b>Example 4:</b> \r\nA boat travels a certain distance downstream in 2 hours and \r\nthe same distance upstream in 2 hours and 10 minutes. How\r\nlong would it take for a raft that travels at the velocity\r\nof the river to travel this distance? \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n<b>Solution:</b> \r\nWe solve the problem algebraically. Let \\(v_b\\) be the velocity of the boat and let \\(v_r\\) \r\nbe the velocity of the river, both measured in meters \r\nper minute. Then the boat travels downstream\r\nwith velocity \\(v_b+v_r\\) and upstream with velocity\r\n\\(v_b-v_r\\). The distance traveled downstream is \r\n\\begin{eqnarray*}\r\n120(v_b+v_r)\r\n\\end{eqnarray*}\r\nand the distance traveled upstream is \r\n\\begin{eqnarray*}\r\n130(v_b-v_r).\r\n\\end{eqnarray*}\r\nThe two distances are equal, hence\r\n\\begin{eqnarray*}\r\n120(v_b+v_r)=130(v_b-v_r).\r\n\\end{eqnarray*}\r\nMultiplying out we obtain\r\n\\begin{eqnarray*}\r\n120v_b+120v_r=130v_b-130v_r.\r\n\\end{eqnarray*}\r\nMoving \\(v_b\\) to the right and \\(v_r\\) to the right\r\nwe have\r\n\\begin{eqnarray*}\r\n(120+130)v_r=(130-120)v_b.\r\n\\end{eqnarray*}\r\nThus \r\n\\begin{eqnarray*}\r\n250v_r=10v_b,\r\n\\end{eqnarray*} which, after dividing\r\nby 10 gives \\(v_b=25v_r\\).\r\nThus the distance that the boat travels is\r\n\\begin{eqnarray*}\r\n120 (v_b+v_r)=120(25v_r+v_r)=120\\times 26v_r=3120v_r.\r\n\\end{eqnarray*}\r\nThe raft travels this distance at the velocity \\(v_r\\), so\r\nit travels this distance in\r\n\\begin{eqnarray*}\r\n\\frac{3120v_r}{v_r}=\\color{red}{3120}\\mbox{ minutes}=\\color{red}{52}\\mbox{ hours}.\r\n\\end{eqnarray*}\r\n</p>\r\n\r\nAnd here is an example with percentages.\r\n\r\n<p><b>Example 5:</b> \r\nWhen the jury of the International Mathematical Olympiad\r\nconsidered the cutoff for medals at 16 points, they realized\r\nthat 52% of the participating students would win medals,\r\nwhich conflicts with the rule that limits this at 50%.\r\nSo the jury changed the cutoff to 17 points, \r\nand by eliminating the\r\n20 students who recieved 16 points, only \r\n48% of the students\r\nwon medals.

I have spent all my life teaching\r\nmathematics to students like you. I have trained the team that\r\nrepresented United States in  the <a href=\"https://www.imo-official.org\">International Mathematical Olympiad</a>  in 1997, 1998, 2002, 2002, and then \r\ncontinuously between 2006 and 2017. I was the Deputy\r\nLeader of the US International Mathematical Olympiad team\r\nin 2008, 2014, and 2016. I have  also helped the \r\nOlympiad programs in  Brazil and India. I\r\nhave been the Leader of the team that represented the \r\nUnited States\r\nat the <a href=\"http://rmms.lbi.ro\">Romanian Master of Mathematics</a> between 2011 and 2017.\r\nI have been  a grader of the papers at the International Mathematical Olympiad in 1999, 2001, and  2003. I serve on\r\nthe USA Mathematical Olympiad Committee since 2013 and\r\nhave been one of the graders of this Olympiad since 1997.\r\nI have written two best sellers about problems solving\r\nin mathematics: \r\n<a href=\"http://www.springer.com/us/book/9781461221388\">Mathematical Olympiad Challenges</a> and\r\n<a href=\"http://www.springer.com/us/book/9780387257655\">Putnam and Beyond</a>. \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nWhen I was your age I learned mathematics by solving many problems and by competing in mathematical Olympiads. I was\r\non the team that represented Romania in 1985 at the International \r\nMathematical Olympiad and the Balkan Mathematical Olympiad.\r\nI was fortunate to learn mathematics from three outstanding\r\neducators, problem solvers and problem posers: Igor Calugaru,\r\n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Titu_Andreescu\">Titu Andreescu</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.imo-official.org/participant_r.aspx?id=9827\">Gheorghe Eckstein</a>. \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nWhat I have learned after so many years of teaching \r\nis that the most important thing in mathematics is\r\nto know how to <font color=\"red\">think</font>. \r\n With the Life to Math package, I want to teach you how to think mathematically in real life situations. \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThis is an introductory\r\npackage, at a very basic level. I assume very little knowledge:\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>how to represent numbers using decimals and fractions</li>\r\n<li>how to add, subtract, multiply, and divide numbers written using decimals</li>\r\n<li>how to add, subtract, multiply, and divide fractions,</li>\r\n<li>some real life experience with weights, distances, money.</li>\r\n</ul> \r\nThe first problems are easy, but as you progress you will encounter harder and harder problems. Remember, it is all\r\nabout how you think mathematically. \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nYou will receive theoretical explanations and\r\nexamples of solved problems, then you will be given problems to\r\nsolve by yourself. And then you will be asked to enter an answer. \r\nYou are given one problem at a time, and you cannot return to a\r\nproblem. Think carefully, do not rush, make sure that\r\nyou solved it correctly, then enter the answer.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThe answer is a whole number, such as 1, 2, -10, 25, or a number\r\nwith decimals. Only the first two decimals are taken into\r\naccount. Thus if your answer is 10, you can enter 10 or\r\n10.0, or 10.00, if your answer is 4.5 you can enter 4.5 or 4.50,\r\nand if your answer is 7.259 you should enter 7.25.  \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nFor every correct answer you receive points, for wrong answers you do not receive points. If you do not know how to solve a problem, you can ask for a hint. Beware! After you ask for a hint, the number of points you can make on that problem decreases. In some cases you are allowed to ask for  a second hint, and then again the number of points you can earn decreases. \r\nBut it is still better to ask for hints than to enter the wrong answer.  \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nAfter you have solved a problem and you have entered the answer, you will be told if the answer is correct or not, and how many points\r\nyou earned. You will be told the total number of points that you\r\nhave at that moment. You will also be shown one or\r\nseveral complete solutions to the problem. Please read them\r\ncarefully, as they might be help with the problems that follow. \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nAt any time you can see, if you want, all theoretical explanations that you have studied so far, but not the ones that\r\nyou will study in the future. You will not be able to see\r\nthe problems that you have already solved, nor will you be able to return to those problems.  \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Click below to see an example\r\nof a problem so that you understand how the package works.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- end explanation of theory  -->\r\n\r\n\r\n")

So half the number of workers means twice the number of days. \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nSimilarly the second team needs \\(\\frac{24}{40}=\\frac{3}{5}\\) as many days as the first to complete the job, so it  has \\(\\frac{40}{24}=\\frac{5}{3}\\) as\r\nmany workers as the first team. And the third team needs \r\n\\(\\frac{30}{40}=\\frac{3}{4}\\) as many days as the first, so\r\nit has \\(\\frac{4}{3}\\) as many workers as the first.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nFrom this discussion we see that the number of workers on\r\nthe first team is a multiple of 3. But how many are they? Can they\r\nbe just 3? Then the second team has \\(\\frac{5}{3}\\times 3=5\\),\r\n the third has \\(\\frac{4}{3}\\times 3=4\\) and the fourth team\r\nhas \\(2\\times 3= 6\\) and so the total number is \\(3+5+4+6=18\\).\r\nThis is not 108!\r\n<p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nBut we can check  that when we double the number of workers on\r\nthe first team, then the number of workers on the second,\r\nthird, third, and fourth also doubles, so the total number doubles.\r\nWe have to increase the total number \\(\\frac{108}{18}=6\\) times,\r\nwhich means that we have to increase the number of people on each team six times. So the first team has \\(6\\times 3=\\color{red}{18}\\) workers, the second team has \\(6\\times 5=\\color{red}{30}\\) workers, the third team has \\(6\\times 4=\\color{red}{24}\\)\r\nworkers, and the fourt team has \\(6\\times 6=\\color{red}{36}\\) workers. And indeed: \\(18+30+24+36=108\\).   \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> Here you see your score for this problem and your total score.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<!-- end explanation of theory  -->\r\n\r\n\r\n")
