figure links:
    -get all pages (view/, theories/, problems/, solve/) and make sure
    server doesn't respond with a missing link error

missing tests:
    -integration tests for site layout and navigation
        -links, html elements present depending on user privalege, routes
    -comprehensive User model test
    -comprehensive Users controller test
    -sessions integration tests
        -type of account, logged in/out

byebye:
    -add "debugger" line to a controller action to get a prompt to evaluate
    code that you think may be causing trouble...obviously the goal is to pick
    the right controller action

marker model test:
    -proportions doesn't unlock proportionstheory2 or subsequent files
        -was because of two spaces, write a test to make sure that all files in
        a context are accessible
    -similiar to above (different bug, same symptom of inacessibility),
    average10 was an inaccessible makeup file because the problem group could
    not exceed missing 7 points

hints:
    -ordering was reverse, write a test to make sure ordering is correct

integration test:
    -regression test that finishing a book doesn't crash the page
        - along these lines, finishing a chapter, a section
    -only allow admins and teachers to "skip" categories
        -two things here a) prevent tool usage b) check for unfinished problems

header test:
    -displayed user type is correct
