why not tdd: goal of first two versions of the website is to allow for Razvan
to prototype his own curriculum designs live and to provide feedback for
anything that needs to be changed on the site
    -since almost everything is subject to change, at the moment,
    a comprehensive test suite doesn't seem like a good use of time

missing tests:
    -integration tests for site layout and navigation
        -links, html elements present depending on user privalege, routes
    -comprehensive User model test
    -comprehensive Users controller test
    -sessions integration tests
        -type of account, logged in/out

byebye:
    -add "debugger" line to a controller action to get a prompt to evaluate
    code that you think may be causing trouble...obviously the goal is to pick
    the right controller action

marker model test:
    -proportions doesn't unlock proportionstheory2 or subsequent files
        -was because of two spaces, write a test to make sure that all files in
        a context are accessible
