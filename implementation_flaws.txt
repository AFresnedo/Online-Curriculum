in model/marker you have a DB call for getting problem attributes, it's faster
to send these as parameters back from the graph

forgot to slice user input to maximum of 2 decimals (so 23.457 would be 23.45)

authenticity token gets cached and becomes stale: fix disease, not symptom
    -first thoughts: you are "getting" a page, so that page could be cached if
    you saw it before, but then you are "posting" data which includes the
    cached authenticity token
        -do i somehow force a refresh of the page every time?
        -do i NOT post the authenticity token, ever, on this page?
