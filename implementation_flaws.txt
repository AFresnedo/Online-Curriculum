in model/marker you have a DB call for getting problem attributes, it's faster
to send these as parameters back from the graph

forgot to slice user input to maximum of 2 decimals (so 23.457 would be 23.45)

didn't realize that where, all search the DB even when they are called upon
a retrieved association (like scores = Score.all; scores.where does a DB call)
    -eager loading can be used in cases such as "for each" (instead of loading
    at every .each you can load 100 records first or something)
        -lazy loading and .each are a bad combo

while a cute hack, the hidden cummulative scores in results view should
probably just be ajax calls (but then again, maybe not, just depending on time
developing & hacky optimized code versus clean organized but slower code)

marker crashes when a book is complete

in theories/view.html.erb you have provide title listing the
filename...probably remove or change this
