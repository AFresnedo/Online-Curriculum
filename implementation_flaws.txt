in model/marker you have a DB call for getting problem attributes, it's faster
to send these as parameters back from the graph

forgot to slice user input to maximum of 2 decimals (so 23.457 would be 23.45)

while a cute hack, the hidden cummulative scores in results view should
probably just be ajax calls (but then again, maybe not, just depending on time
developing & hacky optimized code versus clean organized but slower code)
    -the benefit of ajax here is that it justifies a menu (instead of a table
    representation like Rob said)

in theories/view.html.erb you have provide title listing the
filename...probably remove or change this
